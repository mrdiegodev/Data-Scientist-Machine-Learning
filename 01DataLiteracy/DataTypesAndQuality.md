#Introduction To Data Types and Quality

<h3 style="background-color:#BAFFE6; display: inline-block">The Shape Of Data</h3>

Each invidivial pieace of data is called *entity*, *obserbation* or *instance*

<h5 style="background-color:#BFFFA6; display: inline-block">Variable Types</h5>
    
    - The variables that are measured are _Numerical_ 
    - The variables that are categorized are _Categorical.

    Numerical variables are combination of the measurement and the unit. 
    There are two ways to get a number by *counting* and *measuring*.
    Counting gices us a whole number and *discrete* *varibales*. 
    And measuring gives us potencially partial values and *continuos* *variables*.

    Caterogizal cariables describe characteristics with words or relative values.
    nominal value which literally means a named value
    dichotmous variable onlye has 2 logical possibilities. 
    ordinal value "scale OR RANKING VALUE"

<h5 style="background-color:#BFFFA6; display: inline-block">Accuracy</h5>

    - There are a lot of ways a dataset can have low accuracy, but it all comes down to the question of: “are these measurements (or categorizations) correct?”. 
    - It requires a critical evaluation of your specific dataset to identify what the issues are, but there are a few ways to think about it.

    First, thinking about the data against expectations and common sense is crucial for spotting issues with accuracy. 
    You can do this by inspecting the distribution and outliers to get clues about what the data looks like.

    Second, critically considering how error could have crept in during the data collection process will help you group and evaluate the data to uncover systematic inconsistencies.

    Finally, identifying ways that duplicate values could have been created goes a long way towards ensuring that reality is only represented once in your data. 
    A useful technique is to distinguish between what was human collected versus programmatically generated and using that distinction to segment the data.
